← [Back](19_ROGUE.md)

---

# Purpose

This document defines **immutable visual canon** for Knoxx.

All character, narrative, or personality descriptions are handled in  
→ `19_ROGUE.md`

If visual interpretation conflicts with other documents,  
**this document takes priority.**

---

# Core Visual Identity

Knoxx must immediately read as:

- Veteran street anti-hero
- Vertical and composed
- Controlled danger
- Stillness before precision
- 80s crime-drama presence

No ninja clichés.  
No edgy over-stylization.  
No gothic exaggeration.

---

# Species & Body Structure (LOCKED)

- Black anthropomorphic cat
- Lean hardened frame
- Slightly taller posture than Leader
- Narrow but stable stance
- Economical movement

Must never appear:

- Fragile
- Overly muscular
- Slouched excessively
- Fashion-model stylized
- Anime-proportioned

He is disciplined, not dramatic.

---

# Fur (LOCKED)

- Deep black base tone
- Subtle cold-blue rim reflection under neon light
- No visible patterns
- Matte surface emphasis

Avoid:

- Glossy shine
- Gray tint drift
- High-detail fur rendering

---

# Distinguishing Marks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Torn left ear
- Thin scar across left cheekbone
- Sharp piercing yellow eyes
- Permanent half-squint

These are identity anchors.

Removing them breaks recognition.

---

# Coat (PRIMARY SILHOUETTE ANCHOR)

- Long structured leather coat
- Knee-length
- Matte graphite or deep midnight tone
- Heavy shoulder line
- Clean vertical fall
- Minimal texture noise
- Moves slowly — never theatrically

Forbidden:

- Hood
- Cape-like exaggeration
- Trenchcoat parody flare
- Excessive belts or straps

The coat must feel heavy.

---

# Outfit (LOCKED)

- Dark fitted shirt underneath
- Narrow combat trousers
- Heavy boots
- Simple leather gloves
- Classic metal flip lighter (signature prop)

No jewelry.  
No chains.  
No tactical overload.

---

# Eyes (LOCKED)

- Sharp yellow tone
- Narrow pupil
- Evaluating gaze

Forbidden:

- Wide glowing eyes
- Emotional exaggeration
- Red glow effects
- Cute expression

Eyes must feel analytical.

---

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Knoxx must read instantly in silhouette.

Primary anchors:

- Vertical coat line
- High collar shape
- Slight downward head tilt
- Minimal stance width

Compared to team:

- Leader = balanced
- Bruiser = wide
- Blazer = elongated and dynamic
- Rogue = vertical and composed

---

# Motion Language

Movement must feel:

- Minimal
- Economical
- Controlled
- Efficient

Avoid:

- Flashy spins
- Dramatic coat flares
- Acrobatic excess
- Stylized anime pauses

He wastes no motion.

---

# Tone Enforcement

Knoxx must visually communicate:

- Experience
- Calculation
- Precision
- Quiet threat

He is not mysterious.

He is measured.

---

# Non-Negotiable Markers

Every depiction must include:

- Black fur
- Torn left ear
- Facial scar
- Yellow eyes
- Long leather coat
- Vertical silhouette
- Minimal accessories

If these are missing —  
the character is not Rogue.

---
