# Cat ’Em Up

![Cat ’Em Up](./concept/poster-0.png)

## About

Cat ’Em Up is a high-energy retro 80s neon beat ’em up.

Inspired by arcade cabinets, leather jackets and raw disco-rock energy,  
the game delivers pure side-scrolling street chaos with a feline hero at the center of the fight.

No parody. No meme overload.  
Just neon, impact and arcade intensity.
