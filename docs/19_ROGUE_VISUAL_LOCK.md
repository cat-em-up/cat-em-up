# Core Visual Identity

Knoxx must immediately read as:

- 80s street anti-hero
- Veteran presence
- Vertical and composed
- Controlled danger
- Stillness before precision
- Crime-drama seriousness

No ninja clichés.  
No gothic exaggeration.  
No edgy fashion drift.  
No anime stylization.

He is restraint.

</p>

# Fur (LOCKED)

- No striping
- No gray drift
- No hyper-detail texture

Rendering must prioritize graphic clarity.

These are identity anchors.

Removing them breaks recognition.

---

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Compared to team:

Leader = balanced  
Bruiser = widest  
Blazer = elongated

- Controlled
- Precise

Avoid:
