← [Back](18_BLAZER.md)

# Purpose

This document defines **immutable visual canon** for Jett.

All character, narrative, or personality descriptions are handled in  
→ `18_BLAZER.md`

If visual interpretation conflicts with other documents,  
**this document takes priority.**

---

# Core Visual Identity

Jett must immediately read as:

- 80s metal stage energy
- Lean speed-focused fighter
- Fierce, not glamorous
- Intense without parody
- Electrified motion

No glam exaggeration.  
No fashion-model drift.  
No anime idol energy.

---

# Species & Body Structure (LOCKED)

- Lean athletic feline build
- Elongated leg line
- Narrow waist
- Defined but not bulky musculature
- Long dynamic posture
- Lightweight silhouette

Must never appear:

- Fragile
- Over-sexualized
- Bodybuilder muscular
- Cartoonishly exaggerated proportions

She is speed — not fragility.

---

# Fur (LOCKED)

- Red-orange base tone
- Copper warmth under lighting
- Clean readable color blocking
- No striping patterns

Rendering rules:

- Graphic clarity over realism
- Avoid excessive gradient softness
- Avoid pastel tones

---

# Hair (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Platinum blonde
- Wild 80s energy
- High volume
- Dynamic shape
- Always reads in silhouette

Hair must move with motion.

Forbidden:

- Perfectly styled fashion hair
- Anime spikes
- Soft glam curls
- Short cropped cuts

Hair is a motion amplifier.

---

# Eyes (LOCKED)

- Sharp feline structure
- Predatory gaze
- Neon-reactive under rim lighting
- Controlled intensity

Forbidden:

- Wide innocent eyes
- Cute expression
- Heavy glam sparkle

Eyes must challenge.

---

# Outfit (LOCKED)

## Pants

- Tight black leather
- Clean silhouette
- No bright colors
- No rips
- No fashion overstylization

## Vest

- Sleeveless leather
- Subtle metal studs
- Structured fit
- Not oversized

## Belt & Chains

- Functional metal chains
- Motion accent only
- No excessive layering

## Boots

- High black leather boots
- Strong vertical read
- Not platform fashion boots

## Gloves

- Fingerless
- Functional
- Dark tone

Forbidden:

- Glitter textures
- Excessive glam metal parody
- Neon pink clothing
- Cyberpunk over-detailing

---

# Makeup (CONTROLLED)

- Dark stage-style eye emphasis
- Subtle but readable
- Must not look cosmetic-heavy

No lipstick emphasis.  
No fashion focus.

Intensity, not beauty styling.

---

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Jett must read instantly in silhouette.

Primary anchors:

- Wild hair volume
- Long leg line
- Forward lean
- Chains accenting motion

Compared to team:

- Leader = balanced
- Bruiser = wide
- Blazer = elongated and dynamic
- Rogue = vertical and composed

---

# Motion Language

Movement must feel:

- Quick
- Snapping
- Elastic
- Relentless

Avoid:

- Floaty animation
- Graceful ballet motion
- Overly acrobatic flips
- Comedic exaggeration

Speed must feel dangerous.

---

# Tone Enforcement

Jett must communicate:

- Heat
- Challenge
- Rhythm
- Controlled aggression

She performs through combat.

Not through posing.

---

# Non-Negotiable Markers

Every depiction must include:

- Red-orange fur
- Platinum wild hair
- Lean elongated build
- Leather pants
- Sleeveless vest
- Chains as motion accent
- Fingerless gloves
- High black boots

If these are missing —  
the character is not Blazer.

---
