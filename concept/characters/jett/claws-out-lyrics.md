## Lyrics

```text
[Verse]
Midnight sirens — engines ROAR
Boots hit concrete — ready for WAR
Steel in the air — sparks ignite
No more mercy — OWN the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Heat rising in the underground
Heartbeat pounding — battle drum sound

[Chorus]
CLAWS OUT! — break the chain
CLAWS OUT! — feel the PAIN
Stand TALL — never FALL
CLAWS OUT! — take it ALL

[Bridge]
Neon bleeding through the rain
City calling out our name
No retreat — no doubt
This is what it's all about

[Breakdown / Final]
Lights go red —
No way out —
Three...
Two...
ONE...

CLAWS — OUT!
```
