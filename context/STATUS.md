## Locked Decisions

Title: Cat ’Em Up  
Tagline: Insert Coin. Break Bones. Claws Out.  
Genre: Retro 80s Beat ’Em Up  
Platform: Browser (initial target)  
Core: Engine-agnostic TypeScript simulation layer

Creative Direction:

- Serious 80s arcade tone
- No parody
- Strong silhouettes
- Minimal dialogue
- Emotion through posture and motion
- Subtle homage strategy (no obvious references)

Technical Direction:

- Deterministic simulation core
- Strict separation of Core and Client
- X/Z gameplay plane
- 3D coordinate system (X+, Y+, Z+ defined)
- No rendering logic inside gameplay core
