# Core Visual Identity (LOCKED)

Jett must immediately read as:

- Rock frontwoman energy
- Street-level resistance icon
- Lean, speed-oriented fighter
- Stage presence turned combat presence
- Fierce without glam exaggeration
- Electrified momentum

She is not a fashion model.  
She is not a pop idol.  
She is not parody metal.

She is ignition with intent.

# Species & Body Structure (LOCKED)

- Lean athletic feline build
- Long leg line
- Narrow waist
- Defined but lightweight musculature
- Elongated dynamic silhouette
- Forward kinetic bias in stance

Must never appear:

- Over-sexualized
- Bodybuilder muscular
- Fragile or delicate
- Stylized fashion exaggeration
- Cartoonishly distorted proportions

She is acceleration — not fragility.

# Fur (LOCKED)

- Red-orange base tone
- Copper warmth under lighting
- No striping patterns
- Clean graphic color blocking

Rendering rules:

- Graphic clarity over realism
- Avoid pastel drift
- Avoid excessive gradient softness
- Avoid hyper-textured fur

Her color must feel hot.  
Not cute.

---

# Hair (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Platinum blonde
- High volume
- Wild 80s stage energy
- Strong silhouette readability
- Motion-reactive shape

Forbidden:

- Perfect fashion styling
- Anime spike exaggeration
- Soft glam curls
- Short cuts

Hair must feel like it moves even in still frames.

It amplifies momentum.

---

# Eyes (LOCKED)

- Sharp feline structure
- Predatory focus
- Controlled intensity
- Neon-reactive under rim lighting

Forbidden:

- Innocent softness
- Cute sparkle
- Heavy glam gloss
- Idol-style expressiveness

Her gaze must challenge.

Not invite.

# Makeup (CONTROLLED)

- Dark stage eye emphasis
- Subtle but readable
- Must enhance intensity

No lipstick focus.  
No beauty-styling emphasis.

Intensity, not cosmetics.

---

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Jett must read instantly in silhouette.

Primary anchors:

- High-volume wild hair
- Long leg line
- Narrow waist
- Forward lean
- Chain motion accents
- Boot verticals

Compared to team:

Leader = balanced  
Bruiser = widest  
Blazer = elongated  
Rogue = vertical

Jett must always read as the most dynamic.

---

# Motion Language

Movement must feel:

- Snapping
- Fast
- Elastic
- Rhythmic
- Relentless

Avoid:

- Floaty animation
- Ballet grace
- Circus acrobatics
- Comedic exaggeration

Speed must feel dangerous.

Every strike should feel like a guitar riff —  
tight, sharp, escalating.

# Tone Enforcement

Jett must communicate:

- Heat
- Rhythm
- Challenge
- Escalation
- Stage dominance

She performs through combat.

Not through posing.

She does not entertain.

She overwhelms.

---

# Non-Negotiable Markers

Every depiction must include:

- Red-orange fur
- Platinum wild hair
- Lean elongated build
- Sleeveless leather vest
- White shirt with resistance symbol
- Black leather pants
- Functional chains
- Fingerless gloves
- High black boots

If these are missing —  
the character is not Blazer.
