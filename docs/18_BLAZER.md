**Role:** Blazer  
**Archetype:** Speed / Rhythm / Metal Queen

Blazer accelerates everything.

Stopping is not her nature.

---

## Combat Identity

Her strength is not raw power.

It is tempo.

## Emotional Tone

Blazer represents the moment **during impact**.

Flash.  
Heat.  
Motion.

She is not calm before the storm.

She is the storm.

---

## Design Intent (High-Level)

Blazer must always read as:

- 80s metal energy without parody
- Fierce and intense, not comedic
- Speed embodied
- Controlled aggression, not chaos

Detailed visual enforcement is handled exclusively by the Visual Lock document.
