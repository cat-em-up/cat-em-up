← [Back](17_BRUISER.md)

---

# Purpose

This document defines **immutable visual canon** for Dan.

All character, narrative, or personality descriptions are handled in  
→ `17_BRUISER.md`

If visual interpretation conflicts with other documents,  
**this document takes priority.**

No image references yet.  
This is pure visual rule enforcement.

# Core Visual Identity

Dan must immediately read as:

- Old-school heavyweight street fighter
- Compact power, not bodybuilder bulk
- Grounded and immovable
- Minimalistic and disciplined
- Dangerous without theatrical aggression

No parody.  
No glam exaggeration.  
No modern MMA aesthetic drift.

---

# Species & Body Structure (LOCKED)

- Anthropomorphic Maine Coon
- Broad shoulder line
- Thick neck and trapezius emphasis
- Upper body significantly wider than hips
- Dense compact musculature (no shredded anatomy detail)
- Heavy center of gravity
- Slight forward weight bias in stance

Must never appear:

- Bodybuilder-cut with extreme definition
- Fat or bulky
- Slender or agile-looking
- Fashion-model proportions
- Cartoonishly oversized limbs

He is heavy because of density, not mass exaggeration.

---

# Fur (LOCKED)

- Base fur: light gray
- Subtle Maine Coon texture (not fluffy cartoon)
- No stripes
- No high-contrast patterns
- Fur rendering must remain graphic and readable

Avoid:

- Hyper-realistic fur strands
- Soft pastel rendering
- Anime-style shine gradients

---

# Eyes (LOCKED)

- Cold gray tone
- Narrow pupils
- Sharp, focused gaze
- Low emotional expressiveness

Forbidden:

- Warm amber/yellow glow
- Wide expressive eyes
- Glossy anime highlights
- Soft sympathetic gaze

Eyes must feel calculating and calm.

---

# Mustache (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Thick black mustache
- Short length
- Straight horizontal shape
- Graphic and clean edges
- No curls
- No volume exaggeration

If the mustache shape changes,  
the character identity breaks.

---

# Outfit (LOCKED)

## Vest

- Black sleeveless leather vest
- Matte to semi-matte finish
- Clean structure
- No decorative studs
- No chains
- No metal glam

## Undershirt

- White tank top
- Visible neckline
- Clean silhouette contrast

## Jeans

- Dark worn denim
- Regular fit
- Not skinny
- No rips
- No exaggerated stylization

## Wrist Wraps

- Black
- Functional
- Tight around wrists
- Slight wear texture allowed

## Belt

- Simple
- No flashy buckle
- No thematic emblems

Forbidden:

- Wrestling tights
- Tactical military gear
- Modern MMA branding
- Excessive jewelry
- Chains
- Fingerless gloves (reserved for Leader)
- Boots with exaggerated styling

Dan dresses like a fighter — not a performer.

---

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Dan must read clearly in silhouette.

Primary anchors:

- Wide upper torso
- Thick neck mass
- Clean vest edge line
- Straight mustache shape
- Stable planted stance

Silhouette must feel heavier than Leader.

If placed side by side:

- Dan reads wider.
- Leader reads balanced.
- Blazer reads elongated.
- Rogue reads vertical and narrow.

---

# Stance Rules

Default idle stance:

- Classic guarded position
- Elbows tight to body
- Weight slightly forward
- Minimal motion
- Low bounce
- Controlled breathing

Must never:

- Swing arms loosely
- Overextend gestures
- Lean dramatically backward
- Pose theatrically

He conserves energy.

---

# Motion Language

Movement must feel:

- Economical
- Heavy
- Controlled
- Short-range

Animations must avoid:

- Wide dramatic wind-ups
- Spin-heavy attacks
- Agile flips
- Flashy acrobatics

Dan moves like weight shifting, not speed launching.

---

# Tone Enforcement

Dan must visually communicate:

- Authority
- Stability
- Experience
- Physical consequence

He is not angry.

He is inevitable.

---

# Non-Negotiable Markers

Every depiction must include:

- Maine Coon structure
- Thick straight black mustache
- Broad upper torso
- Sleeveless black leather vest
- White tank top
- Dark jeans
- Black wrist wraps
- Grounded stance

If these are missing —  
the character is not Dan.

---
