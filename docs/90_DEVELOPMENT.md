# Development Principles

## 1. Canon First

1989 is the foundation of the universe.  
Every decision must pass a simple check:

> Would this exist in 1989?

The Meta (Dev) layer exists separately and never breaks canon.

---

## 2. Gameplay > Everything

Style matters.  
World-building matters.  
But if mechanics do not work — nothing works.

We prioritize:

- Controls
- Rhythm
- Impact feel
- Readability

Polish comes after function.

---

## 3. Simplicity Beats Cleverness

- Simple code > clever code
- Clear structure > hidden magic
- Predictability > flashy tricks

If a solution is hard to explain, it is too complex.

---

## 4. Determinism Over Chaos

The game must behave predictably.

- No hidden randomness
- No unexplained magic numbers
- No unclear side effects

Systems must be transparent.

---

## 5. Vertical Thinking

We build vertical slices.

A small, fully working part of the game  
is better than multiple unfinished systems.

---

## 6. No Temporary Hacks

“There will be a refactor later” usually means never.

Either build it properly  
or don’t build it yet.

---

## 7. Clean Layers

We clearly separate:

- Canon Timeline
- Dev / Meta Timeline
- Game Logic
- Visual Layer
- Debug Layer

No mixing of concerns.

---

## 8. One Source of Truth

Data lives in one place.  
Rules are defined in one place.  
Each system has clear ownership.

Duplication creates bugs.

---

## 9. Internal Honesty

Task status reflects reality.

“Almost done” does not exist.

Either:

- Done  
  or
- Not Done

---

## 10. Atmosphere Is a Feature

Cat 'Em Up is not only mechanics.

Darkness.  
Neon.  
Garage.  
Metal.  
1989.

Atmosphere is a system, not decoration.

---

## Core Rule

> If a decision does not make the game clearer, stronger, or simpler — it does not belong.
