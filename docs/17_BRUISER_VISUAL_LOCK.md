# Core Visual Identity (LOCKED)

Dan must immediately read as:

- Old-school heavyweight street fighter
- Compact, dense power
- Grounded and immovable
- Minimalistic and disciplined
- Visually heavy without exaggeration
- Serious without theatrical aggression

No parody.  
No glam exaggeration.  
No modern MMA drift.  
No wrestling-show flamboyance.

# Species & Body Structure (LOCKED)

- Anthropomorphic Maine Coon
- Broad shoulder line
- Thick neck and trapezius mass
- Upper body significantly wider than hips
- Dense compact musculature
- Visible abs but not shredded bodybuilder detail
- Heavy center of gravity

# Fur (LOCKED)

- Base fur: ash gray
- Subtle Maine Coon texture
- No stripes
- No high-contrast patterns
- Graphic rendering, not hyper-realistic

Tone must remain controlled and matte.

---

# Eyes (LOCKED)

- Cold gray tone
- Narrow pupils
- Sharp, focused gaze
- Low emotional expressiveness

No warmth.  
No glow.  
No anime gloss.

Eyes must feel calculating.

# Facial Structure & Marks (LOCKED)

- Thick black straight mustache
- Short length
- Straight horizontal silhouette
- Clean graphic edges
- No tapering ends
- No curls
- No volume exaggeration

Additional identity markers:

- Massive heavy eyebrows
- Slight brow ridge emphasis
- Small scar across one eyebrow

If the mustache changes shape —  
the character identity breaks.

# Silhouette Rules (CRITICAL)

Dan must read instantly in silhouette.

Primary anchors:

- Wide upper torso
- Thick neck mass
- Straight mustache bar
- Broad eyebrow line
- Sleeveless vest cut
- Cargo pocket shapes
- Stable planted stance

Compared to team:

Leader = balanced  
Bruiser = widest  
Blazer = elongated  
Rogue = vertical

Dan must read as the widest presence.

---

# Stance Rules

Default idle stance:

- Feet planted
- Weight forward
- Elbows slightly bent
- Fists tight
- Minimal movement
- No bouncing

He does not warm up.  
He waits.

---

# Motion Language

Movement must feel:

- Economical
- Heavy
- Short-range
- Crushing

Avoid:

- Spin-heavy attacks
- Agile flips
- Flashy wind-ups

Dan shifts weight like gravity.

---

# Tone Enforcement

Dan must visually communicate:

- Authority
- Stability
- Experience
- Physical consequence

He is not angry.  
He is inevitable.

---

# Non-Negotiable Markers

Every depiction must include:

- Maine Coon build
- Ash gray fur
- Thick straight black mustache
- Heavy eyebrows
- Small eyebrow scar
- Sleeveless black leather vest
- Exposed torso
- Dark cargo pants
- White boxing wraps
- Black sneakers
- No undershirt

If these are missing —  
the character is not Dan.
