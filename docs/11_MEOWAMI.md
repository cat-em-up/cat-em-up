![Meowami City](../concept/meowami-0.png)

Meowami City is a neon-soaked coastal metropolis built by cats — and slowly consumed by corruption.

Once a glittering entertainment capital, the city has decayed into a layered battlefield of gangs, political control and crumbling glamour. Night never truly ends here — it only shifts from electric pink to cold blue.

Violence is not chaos.  
It is structure.  
It is territory.  
It is identity.

Syndicates compete.  
Police enforce selectively.  
Citizens endure.

## Tone

- 80s arcade seriousness
- Neon contrast and urban decay
- Stylized, not realistic
- Grit without parody
- Energy without comedy
- Cat-themed cultural identity (subtle, not comedic)

---

## City Identity

- Dense vertical architecture
- Rooftops, alleys, underground clubs
- Industrial docks and abandoned districts
- Flickering signage and broken streetlights
- Fog mixed with sea air
- Cat-owned businesses with claw-marked signage
- Art deco facades with neon highlights

The city should feel alive — but indifferent.

---

## Power Structure

### 🐖 The Pigs — Authority & Organized Crime

The pigs control the upper layers of Meowami.

- City council influence
- Port authority control
- Real estate and construction monopolies
- Nightclubs and high-end establishments
- Political bribery and financial laundering

They do not patrol streets.  
They issue orders.

Publicly: businessmen and officials.  
Privately: crime lords.

They see the city as property.

---

### 🐀 The Rats — Street Gangs

The rats dominate the lower layers.

- Territory-based crews
- Smuggling routes through docks and sewers
- Underground fight clubs
- Protection rackets
- Knife and chain street combat

They are fast, aggressive, territorial.

They do not seek governance.  
They seek control of blocks.

---

### 🐕‍🦺 The Hounds — Police

The hounds represent law — but not justice.

- Street patrol units
- Riot control squads
- Corrupt officers aligned with pig syndicates

Some still believe in order.  
Most protect the system.

They suppress noise.  
They do not fix rot.

---

## Conflict

Pigs and rats compete constantly:

- For districts
- For port access
- For nightlife revenue
- For narcotics and contraband routes

Their war reshapes neighborhoods.

But for ordinary citizens, nothing improves.

Prices rise.  
Businesses close.  
Streets grow dangerous.

War between predators does not create peace.

---

## Narrative Position

Four cats refuse to accept decay.

They are not heroes of the system.  
They are not aligned with pigs, rats or dogs.

They fight for:

- Their neighborhood
- Their people
- Their dignity

They are not saving Meowami.

They are taking it back — one block at a time.

---

## Future Expansion

This document will later define:

- District structure
- Faction territories
- Environmental storytelling
- Boss locations
- Visual palette rules
- Hero starting district
